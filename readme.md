# Captain's Log: A Cruise Journaling Web App
My family and I have a deep passion for cruises - I've been on 17 myself and aim to go once a year if I can! I've been documenting my cruise travels since the young age of 11 and I wanted a way to continue this tradition digitally and also take a peek at my cruise stats without having to dig through records and manually calculate them myself.

Enter Captain's Logâ€”a sophisticated platform designed for users to meticulously record and manage their cruise-related details, including itineraries, preferred excursions, sea conditions, and more. This tool functions as a digital archive, giving users the ability to reflect on past experiences and update their entries at their discretion. The 'My Passport' feature offers a concise overview of the user's cruise portfolio, outlining key metrics such as the number of cruise lines sailed, total days spent on cruise ships, and a breakdown of cruises on each vessel.
